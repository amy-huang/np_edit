This repo was my playground for summer 2017 at LLNL under the guidance of Barry Rountree.

It needs a lot of cleaning up. Will be doing that this fine week of August 29, before I go back to Brown.

Todo:
  delete files that I don't want here any more
  name remaining ones better
  explain what each is for in this readme
  comment the differing bits of each version
