access allowed "senses": 0 is for kill instructions, 1 is for share

if sense (if sense is 1),

get first 4 bits of random 32 bit integer from getRandom()

if this is greater than (less than for sense 0): 

get first 4 bits of 1st word of genome (1st instruction) XOR
1st 4 bits of cell guess (register); OR the bit in 4bits index with 
this and the not of the 2nd cell's parent ID

..then, access is allowed
