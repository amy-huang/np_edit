What makes a cell likely to reproduce and take over the pond? 
I propose that a short genome that doesn't take too much energy, shares energy with all neighbors, and copies its genome to buffer will.

// turn and share energy with all neighbors 
inc register
turn
share
inc register
turn
share 
inc register
turn
share 
inc register
turn
share 
// so that copying genome begins at start
zero pointers, reg
inc register
// loop to make sure copy instructions loop keeps goin
// since loops only end if energy runs out or if reg = 0,
// change the register and share energy with neighbor
inc register
turn
share energy
// loop to copy instructions to outputBuf
begin loop
	read into reg from genome
	write from cell reg to buffer
	inc instr pointers	
	share energy
close loop
turn 
share energy
close loop 
// less energy now, so share again
inc register
turn
share
